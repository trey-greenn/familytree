Family Tree SMS/Chat Script ‚Äì Explanation Document
Purpose

This document provides a structured script of questions that can be sent to users via SMS or chat. The purpose is to collect detailed information about their background, relatives, and family history so that we can build an in-depth, visual family tree.

How It Works

Intro Message

The user receives a friendly greeting and confirmation if they are ready to answer questions.

They can reply "yes" to begin or "no" to exit.

Input Questions

The script is divided into sections that capture progressively deeper layers of the family tree:

User Information (root of the tree)

Parents

Siblings

Children

Grandparents

Optional Stories/Details

Conditional Logic

If the user says they have siblings, the system will loop through collecting sibling details.

Same for children and additional relatives.

This allows flexible tree-building without overwhelming the user at once.

Closing Message

The user receives a thank-you message and instructions on how to update their tree later (‚ÄúUpdate Family‚Äù).

Data Collection Format

Each answer can be stored in structured JSON or database fields (e.g., full_name, birth_year, birthplace).

This makes it easy to plug responses into a React Flow visualization or database for relationship mapping.

Example Flow

Bot: Hi! üëã We‚Äôre building your family tree. I‚Äôll ask you a few quick questions‚Ä¶ Ready?
User: Yes
Bot: What‚Äôs your full name?
User: Sarah Johnson
Bot: What‚Äôs your date of birth?
User: 05/12/1985
Bot: What is your mother‚Äôs full name, birth year, and birthplace?
User: Mary Lee, 1960, Chicago

Why This Matters

Creates a consistent data-gathering process for every user.

Ensures responses are structured for easy mapping and visualization.

Allows users to contribute incrementally without feeling overwhelmed.
